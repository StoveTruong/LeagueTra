12/13: Forgot to enter

12/17: My vision for this project is to have a application that is just as good as op.gg but as a software.
I strived for a clean UX/UI that replaces with the information overload provided and allows the user to see the things that matter the most.
To accomplish that, the API calls must be done all in one. My biggest worry is is it wise to overload a def function that renders in the page for the user? Can this be done all throught the function instead of calling in the app.py file?
